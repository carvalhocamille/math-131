## Lecture 3

## Quick Summary
In lecture 8, we went over the cubic spline interpolant. Recall that interpolation in general is a strategy to approximate a function given several data points \((x,y)\) for that function.  We started with the Lagrange Interpolant, which matches a single polynomial to the data points. However, the Lagrange Interpolant oscillates wildly around the endpoints of the graph, and can occasionally just oscillate extremely wildly around every data point. Cubic splines solve this problem by calculating the Lagrange Interpolant piece-wise. More data about Cubic Splines can be found in the lecture 8 notes.
Today we will be going over:
